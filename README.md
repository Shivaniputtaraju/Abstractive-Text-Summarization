# Let's take closer look!

Here's what it does:

Summarize Text: Paste text or upload a document (TXT or DOCX). The app will create a shorter version capturing the main points.
Pick Your Pages (optional): Uploading a PDF? Choose which pages you want summarized!

# Built with:

* Streamlit (for the web app)
* Python (for the magic behind the scenes)

# How to use it:

Open the app (streamlit run app.py).
Paste your text or upload a document.
For PDFs, pick the pages you want summarized.
Click "Summarize"!
# That's it! The app will show you a shorter version of your text, focusing on the important stuff.
